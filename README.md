# CareerEx Data Science Capstone Project – Income Prediction

## 📘 Overview
This project was completed as part of the **CareerEx Data Science Certification** program.  
It focuses on developing a **machine learning model** to predict whether a person’s **income exceeds $50K per year**, based on their demographic and employment attributes.

By leveraging the **Census Income Dataset**, this project demonstrates my end-to-end data science skills — from data exploration and preprocessing to feature engineering, model building, and performance evaluation.

## 🎯 Project Objective
The objective is to analyze individual census data and build a **classification model** that predicts if an individual earns **“>50K”** or **“<=50K”** annually.  
The project showcases the ability to handle structured data, engineer features, and apply predictive analytics to support data-driven decision-making.

## 📊 Dataset Overview
- **Entries:** 48,842  
- **Features:** 15 (demographic and employment-related)  
- **Target Variable:** Income (<=50K, >50K)  

**Key features include:**
- `Age` – Age of the individual  
- `Workclass` – Employment type (Private, Self-emp, Government, etc.)  
- `Education` and `Education-num` – Highest level of education and years of education  
- `Marital-status`, `Occupation`, `Relationship` – Social and professional attributes  
- `Race`, `Sex`, `Hours-per-week`, `Native-country`

## ⚙️ Project Workflow
1. **Data Import & Cleaning:** Handled missing values, standardized columns, and encoded categorical features.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualized relationships between demographic variables and income levels.  
3. **Feature Engineering:** Created new informative features to improve model accuracy.  
4. **Model Training:** Applied machine learning algorithms for classification.  
5. **Evaluation:** Measured model performance using accuracy and other metrics.  
6. **Insights:** Derived conclusions about key factors influencing income.

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Education level and occupation have strong influence on income levels.  
- Age and hours worked per week also correlate positively with higher income.  
- Government and private employment types show varying income distributions.  
- Feature engineering and model tuning improved predictive accuracy significantly.  

---

## 📈 Results
The final model effectively classifies individuals into income groups with strong predictive accuracy.  
Performance metrics such as **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-score** were used to evaluate the results.
